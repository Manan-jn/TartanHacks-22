Welcome to Stree 
💪 Motivation/Inspiration
Women safety is growing global concern with women being victims of abuse and assault in all spheres of their day to day lives. Delhi tops all the crime charts against of the country with 41% share of the total crimes committed. From rape, abduction to murders, Delhi is changing its status from the political capital of India to the crime capital. Taking this into note, we came up with the idea for our web app Guardian. With our app Guardian we envision to provide women a sense of security so that they can venture into any horizon in life and yet be connected to their safety network.

We have been able to develop safety routes based on previous data records of crime statistics against women in Delhi. We have customized the google map api for our web app to show the safest route for women to travel to their destination calculated on the basis of the ‘danger index’.We have added the feature of SOS alert to emergency contacts and police along with the victims current location using Twilio. Above all, using DashaAI we have managed to add a feature of fake pre recorded phone call that will alert the attacker and prevent the women from any immediate harm.
